		   <font size="+1">Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of the gods of Mount Olympus.
		 His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar,
		 though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, Perkūnas, Perun, Indra, Dyaus and Thor.	
Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as 
the others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually
 said to have fathered Ares, Hebe, and Hephaestus. At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was said to be Dione, by whom 
 the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many
 divine and heroic offspring, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of 
 Troy, Minos, and the Muses.
 <br/><br/><br/>
He was respected as an allfather who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: "Even the gods who are not
 his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence." He was equated with many foreign
 weather gods, permitting Pausanias to observe "That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men".
 Zeus' symbols are the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his Indo-European inheritance,
 the classical "cloud-gatherer" (Greek: Νεφεληγερέτα, Nephelēgereta) also derives certain iconographic 
 traits from the cultures of the ancient Near East, such as the scepter. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek 
 artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand,
 or seated in majesty.  </font></p>

		   <font size="+1">Hera  is the goddess 
		   of women, marriage, family, and childbirth in ancient Greek religion and myth, one of the Twelve Olympians and 
		   the sister-wife of Zeus. She is the daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. Hera rules over Mount Olympus as 
		   queen of the gods. A matronly figure, Hera served as both the patroness and protectress of married women,
		   presiding over weddings and blessing marital unions. One of Hera's defining characteristics is her jealous 
		   and vengeful nature against Zeus' numerous lovers and illegitimate offspring, as well as the mortals who cross
		   her.
</br></br></br>
Hera is commonly seen with the animals she considers sacred including the cow, lion and the peacock. Portrayed as 
majestic and solemn, often enthroned, and crowned with the polos (a high cylindrical crown worn by several of the 
Great Goddesses), Hera may hold a pomegranate in her hand, emblem of fertile blood and death and a substitute for the 
narcotic capsule of the opium poppy. Scholar of Greek mythology Walter Burkert writes in Greek Religion, "Nevertheless,
 there are memories of an earlier aniconic representation, as a pillar in Argos and as a plank in Samos.
Her Roman counterpart is Juno.

		   was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes.[2] His Roman equivalent is Neptune.
</br></br></br>
Poseidon was protector of seafarers, and of many Hellenic cities and colonies. In Homer's Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the 
Trojans during the Trojan War and in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes 
Poseidon's fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, the complete loss of his ship
 and companions, and a ten-year delay. Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn. In Plato's Timaeus and Critias, the island of Atlantis
 was Poseidon's domain.

		   <font size="+1">In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Demeter  is the goddess of the harvest and agriculture, presiding over grains and the fertility of the earth. Her
		   cult titles include Sito (Σιτώ), "she of the Grain", as the giver of food or grain, and Thesmophoros (θεσμός, thesmos:
		   divine order, unwritten law; φόρος, phoros: bringer, bearer), "Law-Bringer", as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural
		   society.
</br></br></br>
Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and 
death. She and her daughter Persephone were the central figures of the Eleusinian Mysteries, a religious tradition that predated the Olympian
 pantheon, and which may have its roots in the Mycenaean period c. 1400–1200 BC. Demeter was often considered to be the same figure as
 the Anatolian goddess Cybele, and in Rome she was identified as the Latin goddess Ceres.

	     <p style="font-family:DIOGENES">
		   <font size="+1">Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, handicraft,
		   and warfare who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as the patron and protectress of
		   various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she most likely received her name. She's usually
		   shown in art wearing a helmet and holding a spear. Her major symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion.
<br/><br/><br/>
From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as Polias and Poliouchos
 (both derived from polis, meaning "city-state"), and her temples were usually located atop the fortified acropolis in the central part
 of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron
 of craft and weaving, Athena was known as Ergane. She's also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as Athena
 Promachos. Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was
 the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.

In Greek mythology, Athena was believed to have been born from the head of her father Zeus. In the founding myth of Athens, Athena bested
 Poseidon in a competition over patronage of the city by creating the first olive tree. She's known as Athena Parthenos "Athena the Virgin,"
 but in one archaic Attic myth, the god Hephaestus tried and failed to rape her, resulting in Gaia giving birth to Erichthonius, an important
 Athenian founding hero.
<br/><br/><br/>
Athena was the patron goddess of heroic endeavor; she's believed to have aided the heroes Perseus, Heracles, Bellerophon, and Jason. 
Along with Aphrodite and Hera, Athena was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War. She plays 
an active role in the Iliad, in which she assists the Achaeans and, in the Odyssey, she is the divine counselor to Odysseus.

In the later writings of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena was said to have competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, 
afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing 
her being raped by Poseidon in her temple. Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom, the arts, and 
classical learning. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.

	     <p style="font-family:DIOGENES">
		   <font size="+1">Apollo is one of the most important and complex of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion 
		   and Greek and Roman mythology. The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and 
		   dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. He is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the 
		   twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros (ephebe, or a beardless,
		   athletic youth), Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods. Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology
		   as Apulu.


As the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle. Apollo is the god 
who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the "averter of evil". Delphic Apollo is the patron of seafarers, foreigners
 and the protector of fugitives and refugees.
<br/><br/><br/>
Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. Apollo delivered 
people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague with his arrows. The invention of archery itself
 is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows. Apollo's 
 capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As the protector of young (kourotrophos), 
 Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children. He presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the 
 prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo.

Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, 
pests and predators were his primary duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil 
constitution. He is associated with dominion over colonists. He was the giver of laws, and his oracles were consulted before setting laws 
in a city.
<br/><br/><br/>
As the god of Mousike (art of Muses), Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music, 
and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. 
In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, Titan god of
 the sun. In Latin texts, however, there was no conflation of Apollo with Sol among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE. 
 Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She was the patron and protector of young girls, and was 
believed to bring disease upon women and relieve them of it. Artemis was worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth 
and midwifery along with Eileithyia. Much like Athena and Hestia, Artemis preferred to remain a maiden and is sworn never to marry.
<br/><br/><br/>
Artemis was one of the most widely venerated of the Ancient Greek deities and her temple at Ephesus was one of the Seven Wonders of 
the Ancient World. Artemis' symbols included a bow and arrow, a quiver and hunting knives and the deer and the cypress were sacred to her.
 The goddess Diana is her Roman equivalent, especially worshipped on the Aventine Hill in Rome, near Lake Nemi in the Alban Hills, and in 
 Campania.

	     <p style="font-family:DIOGENES">
		   <font size="+1">Ares  is the Greek god of war. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, 
		   the son of Zeus and Hera. In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is 
		   the personification of sheer brutality, in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence
		   include military strategy and generalship.

The Greeks were ambivalent toward Ares: although he embodied the physical valor necessary for success in war, he was a dangerous force, 
"overwhelming, insatiable in battle, destructive, and man-slaughtering."[3] His sons Phobos (Fear) and Deimos (Terror) and his lover,
 or sister, Enyo (Discord) accompanied him on his war chariot.[4] In the Iliad, his father Zeus tells him that he is the god most hateful
 to him.[5] An association with Ares endows places and objects with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.[6] His value as a war god 
 is placed in doubt: during the Trojan War, Ares was on the losing side, while Athena, often depicted in Greek art as holding Nike (Victory)
 in her hand, favoured the triumphant Greeks.
<br/><br/><br/>
Ares plays a relatively limited role in Greek mythology as represented in literary narratives, though his numerous love affairs and 
abundant offspring are often alluded to. When Ares does appear in myths, he typically faces humiliation. He is well known as the lover
 of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who was married to Hephaestus, god of craftsmanship. The most famous story related to Ares and
 Aphrodite shows them exposed to ridicule through the wronged husband's device.

The counterpart of Ares among the Roman gods is Mars, who as a father of the Roman people was given a more important and 
dignified place in ancient Roman religion as a guardian deity. During the Hellenization of Latin literature, the myths of Ares
 were reinterpreted by Roman writers under the name of Mars. Greek writers under Roman rule also recorded cult practices and beliefs
 pertaining to Mars under the name of Ares. Thus in the classical tradition of later Western art and literature, the mythology of the
 two figures later became virtually indistinguishable.

		   <font size="+1">Aphrodite is an ancient Greek goddess associated with love, beauty, pleasure, passion and procreation. 
		   She was syncretized with the Roman goddess Venus. Aphrodite's major symbols include myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans.
		   The cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, a cognate of the East Semitic goddess
		   Ishtar, whose cult was based on the Sumerian cult of Inanna. Aphrodite's main cult centers were Cythera, Cyprus, Corinth, and 
		   Athens. Her main festival was the Aphrodisia, which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped
		   as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of prostitutes, an association which led early scholars to propose the 
		   concept of "sacred prostitution" in Greco-Roman culture, an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.
<br/><br/><br/>
In Hesiod's Theogony, Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (aphrós) produced by Uranus's genitals, which his son 
Cronus has severed and thrown into the sea. In Homer's Iliad, however, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Plato, in his Symposium 180e,
 asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: Aphrodite Ourania (a transcendent, "Heavenly" Aphrodite) and Aphrodite
 Pandemos (Aphrodite common to "all the people"). Aphrodite had many other epithets, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess,
 or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as Cytherea (Lady of Cythera) and Cypris (Lady of Cyprus), because both locations
 claimed to be the place of her birth.
<br/><br/><br/>
In Greek mythology, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and metalworking. Despite this, Aphrodite was
 frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers; in the Odyssey, she is caught in the act of adultery with Ares, the god of war. In 
 the First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, she seduces the mortal shepherd Anchises. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of 
 the mortal shepherd Adonis, who was killed by a wild boar. Along with Athena and Hera, Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose
 feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War and she plays a major role throughout the Iliad. Aphrodite has been featured in 
 Western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of Western literature. She is a major deity in modern
 Neopagan religions, including the Church of Aphrodite, Wicca, and Hellenismos.

		   child. He was cast off Mount Olympus by his mother because of his deformity or, in another account, by Zeus
		   for protecting Hera from his advances.
<br/><br/><br/>
As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus. He served as the blacksmith of
 the gods, and was worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centers of Greece, particularly Athens. The cult of
 Hephaestus was based in Lemnos. Hephaestus' symbols are a smith's hammer, anvil, and a pair of tongs.

			sandals. Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide" — a conductor of souls into the afterlife.
			<br/><br/><br/>

In myth, Hermes functioned as the emissary and messenger of the gods,and was often presented as the son of Zeus and Maia,
 the Pleiad. Just as well, he is regarded as "the divine trickster," for which Homer offers the most popular account
 in his Hymn to Hermes.

His attributes and symbols include the herma, the rooster, the tortoise, satchel or pouch, winged sandals, and winged 
cap, as well as the palm tree, goat, the number four, several kinds of fish, and incense. However, his main symbol 
is the caduceus, a winged staff intertwined with two snakes copulating and carvings of the other gods. His attributes 
had previously influenced the earlier Etruscan god Turms, a name borrowed from the Greek "herma".

In Roman tradition, Hermes was known as Mercury,a name derived from the Latin merx, meaning "merchandise," and from 
where we get the words "merchant" and "commerce."

		   of domesticity, the family, the home, and the state. In Greek mythology, she is the eldest daughter and

		   <br/><br/><br/>
Customarily, in Greek culture, Hestia received the first offering at every sacrifice in the household. In the
 public domain, the hearth of the prytaneum functioned as her official sanctuary. With the establishment of a new colony,
 flame from Hestia's public hearth in the mother city would be carried to the new settlement.

		   <font size="+1">Dionysus or Dionysos is the god of the grape-harvest, winemaking and wine, of fertility, 
		   ritual madness, religious ecstasy, festivity and theatre in ancient Greek religion and myth.

He is also known as Bacchus , the name adopted by the Romans;the frenzy he induces is bakkheia. His thyrsus, 
sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those 
who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. As Eleutherios ("the liberator"), his wine, music and ecstatic 
dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. 
Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.
	   <br/><br/><br/>
In his religion, identical with or closely related to Orphism, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of Zeus
 and Persephone, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus. Many believed that he had been born 
 twice, having been killed and reborn as the son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. In the Eleusinian Mysteries he was identified with
 Iacchus, the son (or, alternately, husband) of Demeter.

His origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek.Though most
 accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner, evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek 
 history show that he is one of Greece's oldest attested gods. His attribute of "foreignness" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent
 and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called "the god that comes".
	   <br/><br/><br/>
Wine played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its
 consumption. Wine, as well as the vines and grapes that produce it, were seen as not only a gift of the god, but a symbolic incarnation
 of him on earth. However, rather than being a god of drunkenness, as he was often stereotyped in the post-Classical era, the religion
 of Dionysus centered on the correct consumption of wine, which could ease suffering and bring joy, as well as inspire divine madness distinct
 from drunkenness. Performance art and drama were also central to his religion, and its festivals were the initial driving force behind 
 the development of theatre.[13] The cult of Dionysus is also a "cult of the souls"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings,
 and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god.
